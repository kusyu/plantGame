# Plant Game
Extremely early build

Controls: 
- use the mouse to click and drag items
  - yes, I know fertilizer doesn't work -- I haven't implemented that yet
- right click a plant to see options to propogate or sell the plant
- left click a dead plant to remove it


Issues:
- propogation is still kinda wonky with where it places plants -- some plants might spawn over each other, causing issues
- timing issues
- plant's can't have more than 1 status ailment rn

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
